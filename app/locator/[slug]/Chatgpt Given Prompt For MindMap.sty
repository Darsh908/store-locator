Create a detailed mind map of features and services for a comprehensive retail store ERP and store locator platform. The map should include categories like Store Locator & Maps (geolocation, filters, directions, custom markers), Inventory & Order Management (multi-location stock, click-&-collect, POS integration), Listings & Local SEO (bulk listing sync, NAP consistency, directory management), Marketing & Promotions (local content publishing, event calendars, social media and ad scheduling), Customer Engagement (reviews aggregation, automated responses, loyalty programs), Analytics & Reporting (foot-traffic metrics, conversion attribution, BI dashboards), and Team/Administration (role-based access, workflows, API integrations). Highlight any advanced innovations (e.g. real-time inventory search, appointment booking, queue management, voice search optimization) that differentiate this solution.
